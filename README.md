# Fallout Terminal Hack Game

This is a clone of [fallout_terminal_hack_game](https://github.com/brianburton/fallout_terminal_hack_game) written in Java. I take no credit for the idea.

## Playing
I've included the compiled `jar` file.

*nix Systems:
* `$ ./exec.sh`

Windows:
* ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

### Todo:
* Add a "hint" option: although not documented, the original implementation of the game includes this.
